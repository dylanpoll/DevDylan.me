This is my website and it uses react.js.

This is currently being re worked from the ground up due to learning more as time went by I decided re writing it from the ground up would be more appropriet. The new version is using typescript, and has better security and state management.
Due to the rebuild not being complete I am leaving this as is as it is how the site currently is online. I will overwrite this upon launch of my rebuild taking the domain over.
I plan to re launch all my sites using a simular base but re skinned and features re created accordingly for all my prior and current react website projects.

Progress will be posted on a seperate repo as a react typescript project when updates come in.
